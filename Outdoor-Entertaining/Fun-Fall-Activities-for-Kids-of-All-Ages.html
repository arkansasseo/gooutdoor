<p>Fundraising for fishing group projects can also involve fishing methods. There are so many types of fishing styles and techniques, that a fishing club in a specialized region can help educate others about the best fishing practices in the area.

<p>Imissed out on a few opportunities and i&nbsp;am looking to refine my strategy for future, as the specifics don't align perfectly for this scenario very often. We look for multiple (think cabins cottages) properties to rent out for vacation rentals. The ideal is, near or on a lake, in mountain town (we are in colorado) and can be rented together for family reunions, events. Or separately. The location does well and is basically a given that with rocky mountain national park nearby and a lot of other outdoor activities&nbsp;- everything rents out all summer and a few months on each end, no problem.</p>
